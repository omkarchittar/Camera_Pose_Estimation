## **Installation and Running**

1. Download and extract the files.

2. Run the code Problem.py using the following command in your terminal
    ***python3 Problem.py***
Two pop up windows:
**window 1**: Roll, Pitch and Yaw versus time graph.
**window 2**: Tx, Ty, Tz versus time graph.
**The terminal displays the following**:
 - The frame which is currently being read and the coordinates of the corners of the sheet of paper in that frame.

### For plotting graphs directly uncomment the corners
### Have stored the co-ordinates from all the frames in a list obtained by once running the code

3. A detailed report of the entire project is given in ***report.pdf***
